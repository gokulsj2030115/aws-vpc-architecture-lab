# 🚀 AWS VPC Architecture Lab

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a secure AWS VPC setup with **public and private subnets**, using an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** and **NAT Gateway** for controlled internet access.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

* VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
* Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
* Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
* IGW + NAT Gateway
* Route Tables controlling traffic
* EC2 instances in both subnets

## 🔄 Traffic Flow

* Public: Internet → IGW → EC2
* Private: EC2 → NAT → IGW → Internet
